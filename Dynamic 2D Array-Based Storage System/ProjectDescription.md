# Dynamic 2D Array Storage for Name Codes

The main objective is to create a dynamic 2D array structure to store name codes, which are generated by transforming names using a specified transformation function. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of dynamic memory allocation, array manipulation, and the implementation of transformation functions in C.

## About the Developer
Hello! I’m Emre Akoda, a student at Middle East Technical University currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.

I have a keen interest in programming and enjoy tackling challenges related to memory management, data structures, and system design. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of dynamic memory allocation, array manipulation, and the implementation of transformation functions in C.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback regarding this project!

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Store name codes in a 2D dynamic array structure.
2. Implement functions to transform names into name codes.
3. Manage dynamic memory allocation for arrays in C.

## Specifications
The project includes:
1. **IndexArray**: An array of size `N`, where each element points to a DataArray.
2. **DataArray**: Arrays of integers where name codes are stored. Each IndexArray element points to a DataArray.

### Name Code Transformation
The transformation function converts a name into a name code using the formula:
\[ C = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)^2 \times \text{name}[i] \]
where `name[i]` is the ASCII code of the character at position `i`.

#### Example
For the name "John":
- J → \(1^2 \times 74 = 74\)
- o → \(2^2 \times 111 = 444\)
- h → \(3^2 \times 104 = 936\)
- n → \(4^2 \times 110 = 1760\)

The name code `C` is calculated as \(74 + 444 + 936 + 1760 = 3214\).

## Functions

1. **int transform_name(const char *name)**: Generates a name code for the given name.
2. **int** initialize_storage(int IA_size, int DA_size, int** DA_sizes)**: Initializes the 2D array structure.
3. **void print_storage(int** storage, int IA_size, int* DA_sizes)**: Prints the content of the 2D array.
4. **void insert(int** storage, int IA_size, const char* name, int* DA_sizes)**: Inserts a name code into the 2D array.
5. **void insert2(int** storage, int IA_size, int name_code, int* DA_sizes)**: Inserts a name code directly into the 2D array.
6. **void fill_new_storage(int** storage, int IA_size, int** new_storage, int* DA_sizes, int* new_DA_sizes)**: Transfers the content from old storage to new storage.
7. **void resize_IA(int*** storage, int* IA_size, int DA_size, int** DA_sizes)**: Extends the IndexArray size if necessary.
